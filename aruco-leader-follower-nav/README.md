# üöÅ ArUco-Based Leader‚ÄìFollower Navigation with TurtleBot 4

## üìö Overview
This project implements a **leader‚Äìfollower navigation strategy** for mobile robots using **ROS 2** and **TurtleBot 4** platforms.  
A **leader robot** is tracked by a **follower robot** through **visual detection** of an **ArUco marker** mounted on the leader, using an onboard **Intel RealSense D435i RGB-D camera**.  
The system supports both **real-world experiments** and **Ignition Gazebo simulations**, including **dynamic obstacle avoidance** and **collaborative navigation**.

## üéØ Project Goals
- Develop a **robust leader‚Äìfollower strategy** using vision-based pose estimation.
- Validate the system both **in simulation** and **in real-world testing**.
- Implement **cooperative obstacle avoidance** strategies between leader and follower.
- Evaluate performance through **tracking accuracy**, **network latency**, and **controller comparisons** (PID vs SMC).

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Leader‚ÄìFollower System** based on ArUco visual tracking.
- **Multi-Level Testing** including dynamic following, motion law emulation, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Dual Control Strategies**: PID and SMC.
- **Real-world Experiments** and **Ignition Gazebo Simulations**.
- **Collaborative Obstacle Avoidance**.
- **Full ROS 2 Integration** leveraging DDS communication.
