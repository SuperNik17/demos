# üöÄ Full-Scale Rover Prototype

This section presents the development and structure of the **full-scale rocker-bogie rover**, designed to validate kinematic behaviors, mechanical stability, and terrain-interaction capabilities at real-world dimensions. It follows the initial proof-of-concept developed with the small-scale rover.
