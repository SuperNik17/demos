#  Full-Scale Rover Prototype

This section presents the development and structure of the **full-scale rocker-bogie rover**, designed to validate kinematic behaviors, mechanical stability, and terrain-interaction capabilities at real-world dimensions. It follows the initial proof-of-concept developed with the small-scale rover.

</p>

- Frame: T-slot aluminum profiles (30×30 mm)
- Joints: Custom-designed PLA/ABS parts
- Wheelbase: 1000 mm
- Width (outer wheel-to-wheel): 892 mm
- Overall height: ~474 mm
- Total mass (unloaded): 64 kg 
- Passive rocker-bogie suspension
- Motor mounts and sensors still under integration

##  Motor & Driver Specs

The full-scale rover uses brushless DC motors controlled by **Stepdriver DBLS‑01S** motor drivers, capable of PID regulation. Below are the key specs:

### 🔌 Electrical & Mechanical Parameters

| Parameter               | Value                  |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| DC Supply Voltage      | 36 V                   |
| Continuous Current     | 8.3 A                  |
| Peak Current (3 s)     | 13 A                   |
| Max Motor Power        | 350 W                  |
| Driver Output Power    | 200 W                  |
| Gear Ratio             | 10 : 1                 |
| No-Load Speed          | 5000 rpm               |
| Stall Torque           | 0.8 N·m                |
| PID Gains              | Kₚ = 20, Kᵢ = 10       |

 Drivers support multiple input voltages (24 V, 36 V, 48 V), with reduced current draw as voltage increases.  
In this configuration, the system runs at 36 V DC.


##  Configuration Comparison

During the construction process, two different wheel configurations were considered:

- **Configuration A** – Inline mounting of all wheel arms
- **Configuration B** – Alternating layout (inner–outer–inner)

##  Notes

- The structure has been dimensioned to accommodate onboard sensors, motor drivers, and computing units.  
- Cable routing and protection channels are integrated along the frame.
