# ðŸŽ¯ Handâ€“Eye Calibration for Mobile Robot Manipulation

This module presents a MATLAB-based implementation of a **marker-based handâ€“eye calibration** pipeline between an external camera and its end-effector. The system is designed to work with **unstructured fiducial markers** (such as custom patterns), offering flexibility across different platforms and camera models.
