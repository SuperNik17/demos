# ðŸŽ¯ Handâ€“Eye Calibration for Mobile Robot Manipulation

This module focuses on the implementation and testing of a **marker-based handâ€“eye calibration** pipeline between a fixed camera and a mobile manipulator mounted on a wheeled robot. The goal is to estimate the transformation between the robotâ€™s end-effector frame and the camera coordinate frame to enable vision-based manipulation and localization.
