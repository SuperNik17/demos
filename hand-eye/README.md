# üéØ Hand‚ÄìEye Calibration for Mobile Robot Manipulation

This module presents a MATLAB-based implementation of a **marker-based hand‚Äìeye calibration** pipeline between an external camera and its end-effector, fundamental for **Position-Based Visual Servoing (PBVS)**. The system is designed to work with **unstructured fiducial markers** (such as custom patterns), offering flexibility across different platforms and camera models.

---

## üß† Project Overview
The pipeline is designed for a **mobile robotic platform** equipped with a fixed onboard RGB-D camera. However, all current **experiments were performed off-board**, without an actual mobile base. The camera is positioned to capture both the **end-effector** and a portion of the **surrounding environment**, ensuring spatial observability for hand‚Äìeye calibration.

- **Objective:** Estimate the transformation matrix `X` in the equation `AX = XB`
- **Setup:**  
  - Mobile base with fixed onboard camera for perception.
  - Robotic arm or mock end-effector  
  - Fiducial markers for reference frame estimation
- **Implementation:** Developed in **MATLAB**, using rigid body transformations and vision-based pose estimation  
- **Marker:** Non-structured ‚Äî supports custom patterns if implemented with segmentation  
- **Use case:** Moving object in the robot workspace
