# 🤖 Centralized Control Node for Multi-Robot Systems (ROS 2)

This repository contains a centralized controller for coordinating the motion of **two differential-drive mobile robots** (e.g., TurtleBot3) using ROS 2. The system supports **real-time trajectory generation**, **state-space control**, and **sensor fusion from multiple localization sources**.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This node allows full control over a multi-agent system, enabling behaviors such as:
- Leader-follower navigation
- Formation maintenance
- Relative pose control
- Distributed feedback from AMCL, ArUco, or odometry

Key features:
- 🔁 Trajectory generation (sinusoidal or φ-parametrized)
- ⚙️ Flexible control schemes (`Kp`, `Kpid`, `Kcentralized`) via JSON
- 🛰️ Multiple localization inputs (AMCL, ArUco, LSM, Simulated Odom)
- 📤 Reference broadcasting for visualization and logging
- 🧪 Designed for real-world testing and Gazebo simulation

## ⚙️ Requirements

- ROS 2 (tested on **Humble** / **Foxy**)
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies:
  - `geometry_msgs`
  - `nav_msgs`
  - `std_msgs`
  - `std_srvs`
  - `rclpy`

Ensure controller configs are present under:
central_pkg/config/ 
  ├── Kp.json 
  ├── Kpid.json 
  └── Kcentralized.json
