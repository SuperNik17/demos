##   Project goal  
During a visiting period at UniUD we designed and field-tested a LiDAR-only autonomous-navigation pipeline aimed at coordinating multiple **AGILEX Scout Mini** robots. Key elements:

* Real-time odometry pose estimation with **Direct LiDAR Odometry** (DLO)
* 2-D mapping via **GMapping** with and without pre-recorded map
* **AMCL** for localization
* **Move Base** for global & local path-planning
* **Master-Slave Multi-Agent**: the master builds the map and streams way-points; the slave localises with AMCL into the master's map and follows them

##   Hardware 
* **Robot:** AGILEX Scout Mini with CAN/USB interface  
* **Sensor:** Velodyne VLP-16 (16-beam LiDAR)  
* **Onboard Compute:** NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX (CUDA 11)  
* **Networking:** on-board Wi-Fi routers; single LAN for multi-robot (master acts as AP, slave as client)

##   Logical architecture
LiDAR → DLO → {  (1) GMapping → /map
                  (2) pre-map + AMCL → /map } → Move Base → cmd_vel

* **Single robot:** choose (1) live map or (2) saved map with AMCL drift correction.  
* **Multi-robot:** master runs (1); slave receives the shared map, localises with AMCL and tracks the master’s way-points.

###  Single-Agent Setup – Hardware Architecture

###  Single-Agent – ROS Architecture

*ROS-based software stack for single agent: DLO for pose, GMapping or AMCL for localisation, and Move Base for planning.*



###  Multi-Agent Setup – Hardware Architecture

![Multi Agent Hardware](img/multi_agent_hardware_arch.png)

*Two Scout Minis connected via Wi-Fi. Master robot builds the map; slave receives and uses it via AMCL.*



###  Multi-Agent – ROS Architecture

##   Results & open issues
* **Accuracy:** DLO + AMCL < 5 cm on 20 m indoor.  
* **Drift:** without AMCL, visible (> 0.5 m) after ~10 min continuous run.  
* **Swarm:** slave localisation still sensitive to sharp turns; considering map-merge (`multirobot_map_merge`) for extra robustness.

##   Next steps
* Cross-calibration of maps between robots  
* Heuristic multi-robot map-merge  
* Integrate IMU in DLO loop to cut residual drift  
* Outdoor field trials
